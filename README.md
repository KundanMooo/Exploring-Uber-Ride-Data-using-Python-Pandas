# Exploring-Uber-Ride-Data-using-Python-Pandas
This project involves analyzing Uber ride data using Python Pandas to identify popular pickup/drop-off locations, common routes, and customer purposes.
It also includes data cleaning, calculating average distance, and performing search operations.
 This project focuses on the analysis of Uber ride data, encompassing tasks such as identifying null values, determining popular start and stop locations,
 filtering out rides with identical start and stop locations, determining the most frequently visited destinations, identifying preferred start points, 
 calculating distances between favorite start and stop points, correcting data types, removing unknown locations, 
 and analyzing monthly bookings and total miles covered by customer type.
 Additionally, the analysis includes determining the percentage of business customers among Uber cab travelers. 
 The project provides valuable insights into ride patterns, customer preferences, and business travel trends within the Uber dataset.
